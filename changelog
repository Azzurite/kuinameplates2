* This is a complete rewrite of KuiNameplates for Legion. It isn't completely
finished yet. Read the description on Curse for more information.
* Notably, some configuration is missing because I haven't got around to it
yet. Don't worry. You don't need to tell me. I know.
* Your configuration will be reset for this version as I no longer use Ace3 to
provide it. If you had some massively complex config set up, sorry about that.
* External addons will need to be rewritten, and a custom.lua replacement
doesn't exist yet, but of course people who have knowledge of lua can still
make their own modifications.
