This is an in-development complete rewrite of Kui Nameplates which will replace the current version when the Legion pre-patch is released.

The rewrite separates nameplate frame creation, event handling and visible frame creation such that each of these components is easier to maintain. It also supports third-party layouts.

### Everything flashes!

Run this in game: /console releaseuitextures 0

This CVar being enabled by default is probably just a beta thing.
