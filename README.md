This is a complete rewrite of Kui Nameplates which will replace the current version when the Legion pre-patch is released.

The rewrite separates nameplate frame creation, event handling and visible frame creation such that each of these components is easier to maintain. It also supports third-party layouts.

Progress is on-going under the [legion branch](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/tree/legion).
